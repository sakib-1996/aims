                                    <p class="mb-5">The aim of this version of the ethical standards are designed to cater for practitioners, psychologists, counsellors, psychotherapists, coaches, imams, raqis, and chaplains providing a myriad service within their respective areas.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>The Mission of the Association of Islamic Mental-Health Specialists (AIMS)</strong></p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">The Association of Islamic Mental Health Specialists is dedicated to serving the entire ‘community of care’ within the Umma, including qualified professionals, imams, chaplains, and members of the Muslim community who may lack formal training yet play in an important role in communal wellbeing. In relation to this mission, we intend to ground clinical, pastoral, and community caregivers in the framework of the Qur’an and Sunnah as it pertains to psychospiritual healing, while incorporating contemporary insights that will assist such caregivers in their efforts to aid the ailing members of our community, allowing them to overcome their difficulties and attain higher degrees of mental and spiritual stability.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>A New Code for a Nascent Field</strong></p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">The Code presents a detailed, systematic synthesis of Islamic, ethical, legal, and clinical approaches to mental health that intends to overcome the limitations of contemporary codes of practice, which tend to be vaguely-worded, over-generalised, and limited in content. Such codes fail to provide a framework sufficient to address the complexities of providing counselling to the Anglophone Muslim community of the 21st century, and accordingly, there is a pressing need to present a more comprehensive, behaviour-oriented ethical code to Muslim caregivers owing to:</p>

                                    <ul class="mb-5">
                                        <li class="mb-3">A regrettable corpus of evidence of unprofessional or damaging practices among Muslim caregivers, which results in community harm and distrust towards counsellors;</li>
                                        <li class="mb-3">The legally tenuous status of Muslim counselling as a result of state scrutiny, increasing litigation against Muslim counsellors, and a continuing centralisation of professional ethics; and</li>
                                        <li class="mb-3">The growing relevance and vitality of the field of Muslim counselling – which now includes a number of theories and frameworks – that indicates the need for a universal ethical/legal framework to guide future models of Qur’anic and Islamic counselling.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>Islamic Principles for Objective Formulation</strong></p>
                                    <p class="mb-5">While secular counselling aims at achieving individual well-being within the confines of this world, Islam defines well-being from an entirely different viewpoint. A Muslim is directed to seek this wellbeing as stated in the Qur'an: "Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the hereafter" (2:201).</p>

                                    <p>This is the primary difference in the worldview of Muslims and non-Muslims. The concepts of well-being, satisfaction, salvation, self-realization, and achievement are linked with the belief that an individual's performance in this life determines the ultimate outcome in the hereafter: "What is cultivated in this world is to be harvested in the hereafter" (42:20). This basic assumption determines the fundamental goals of any therapeutic program. These cardinal principles are seen as the cornerstone of any attempt to formulate an Islamic theory:</p>


                                    <ul class="mb-5">
                                        <li class="mb-3">An individual is born with an innate innocence that needs to be preserved and enhanced. It is society's obligation to provide conducive conditions for such an upbringing.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-3">Material and spiritual well-being is achievable through a profound submission to the will of God. Those who fail to submit are in a state of conflict and their personalities begin to disintegrate. According to the Qur’an, a life without faith is a state of spiritual non-being in which one loses touch with his/her true self (49:19). Religion provides guidance and cultivates mental health. Faith is seen as an essential prerequisite for the treatment of mental, emotional, or behavioural disorders. A consensus on the therapeutic value of faith is evident from the writings of Ibn Sina, al-Ghazzali, Ibn Miskawayh, al-Razi, Ibn al-Qayyim, Shah Waliy Allah, and many other Muslim thinkers.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-3">An individual has the ability to reason and the freedom of choice. The right path has been shown by revelation (divine books) granted to individuals of the highest spiritual standing (prophets). These gifts, according to the Qur'an, are to be used to choose the way of life: "We showed him the way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful" (76:3); "And we have shown him the two ways" (90:10); "By the soul and the proportion and order given to it, it has been enlightened to opt for the wrong provided therein or the right revealed to it. Truly he succeeds that purifies it and he fails that corrupts it" (91:7-10).</li>
                                        <p class="my-4">While human beings are free to select their own path(s), there is an associated sense of accountability. As humanity has been declared the vicegerent of God (2:30), it is held accountable for its options, efforts, and behaviour. Every soul is held accountable in pledge for its deeds (74:38), and an individual can only have what he/she strives for (53:39-41).</p>
                                        <li class="mb-3">Islam requites a community that has a social function, for it is not confined to the individual-God relationship, but rather seeks to create a strong, healthy, and well-organized social life. The fabric of social life is the doctrine that Muslim communal brotherhood is a vehicle for social welfare, wider peace, and the attainment of harmony in social bonds. This system of social health must be maintained by establishing the institutions of advice, discipline, and welfare for the benefit of all.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="mb-5">
                                        This ummatic concept is based on a system of social relations that seeks to maximize the enjoinment of good on earth within the divine plan: "There may spring from you a community (ummah) who invite to goodness and enjoin good conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who ate successful" (3:104). This is a trust (ummah) bestowed upon Muslims that needs to be realized as one of the aims of the Shari'ah. In order to integrate the Muslim community, the institution of sincere advice is perceived as a fundamental obligation: "You are the best ummah that has been raised up for mankind. You enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency and you believe in Allah" (3:110).
                                        On the basis of these principles, the ultimate goal of Islamic counselling would be to develop an Islamic personality. This personality needs to be healthy, balanced, and well-integrated and have all of its drives, emotions, and cognitive operations directed towards a pursuit for the pleasure of God.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">This type of personality is successful in overpowering the evil prone self (nafs ul ammarah). Deviant pathological behaviour is corrected by an inducement of the reproaching self (nafs ul lawwamah).</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">The ultimate target is the attainment of absolute and constant contentment (nafs al mutma’innah), which is possible through a consonance of the human psyche with God. This is the stage of the constant contentment of psyche. If the ultimate objective of Islamic counselling is this contentment, the needed instruments for its realization include the constant remembrance of God (dhikr), truthfulness (sidq), and sincerity (ikhlas).</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>The Islamic Shariah (Qur’anic) foundations of the AIMS ethics code</strong></p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">The Divine guidance of Islam (the Sharia) is considered by scholars to return to one principle: that of mercy — which in practice means seeking to avert harm and acquire benefit for as many of God's creation as possible. The classical scholars, upon surveying all of rulings of Islamic law, determined that this 'benefit' returns to five (or six) principles, which form the basis of the rights-paradigm of Islam.</p>
